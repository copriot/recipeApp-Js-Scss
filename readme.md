<h1>Recipe Website</h1>

<p>
This project is a fully responsive cooking recipe website. It's developed using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code follows a modular structure to manage the site's functionalities, and user preferences are stored using localStorage. Additionally, shopping cart operations are implemented for recipes, and the items in the cart are managed using the UUID library. Access to an extensive cooking recipe database is facilitated through the Forkify API.</p>
